It may be a game or a learning app, but how about a trivial application? SavvyMinds is designed to let you learn more even in fields you have never been to and make you the smarter version of yourself while allowing you to have some fun. Select the category you want to play and let's go. 

You can build on your focus and alertness by playing our Time Rush or Survival Quest games. You can also try your hands on our Challenge of the Day and attempt to get a perfect score on our highly incentivized but challenging question.

You can also form a play with other people with our Contest Mode or Survival Showdown. You can also form a Team with other people on SavvyMinds and have a fun face-off with another team. We call this Team Battle.
